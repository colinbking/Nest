# Nest
Nest placed first overall at the Rice University 2019 Spring Hackathon (HackRice 8.5).

## What is Nest?
Nest is an iOS app that incentivizes students to break out of the monotony of life. By gamifying the student experience at Rice University, Nest allows students to take advantage of more opportunities, explore new areas of campus, and engage in friendly competition. Users “hatch eggs” (i.e. earning badges and achievements), like the "Fondy Fanatic" egg, done by remaining in Fondren Library for 36 consecutive hours with only one hour of break, or "Rayzor Sharp" where the user must attend the cultural tables in Rayzor Hall at least 3 times in one week. Additionally, they can share these achievements with their friends, complete weekly challenges, or redeem their rewards points (called Talons) for gifts such as a free drink at Coffeehouse or East West Tea (a rewards system hopefully implemented in the future).

Nest tracks the user's progress toward each achievement by using geo-fencing, a technique where a virtual perimeter is established around a geographic area. Whenever a user enters or exits that region, they trigger an event. By observing where the user goes, Nest can log the user's progress towards each achievement.

An example of the app in use can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TN4TXioNUk&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR3lx71S01EKUNHFCFnaOf08XDKmZO8ESNoEq1ABY4wz-cpkbb_rn-iPxSE). This video walks through the main features of the app. In [this other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyI2vAL3Mj8), the user is at 99% completion for the "Fondy Fanatic" egg. After he walked into the library, he triggered the geo-fence and unlocked the achievement.

When creating Nest, our main goal was to encourage Rice students to take full advantage of the experiences available at Rice. University is a unique experience for many students, as they are surrounded by and embedded within a lively and active culture with students of diverse backgrounds for the first time. However, difficult classes and strenuous workloads often cause students to slip into harmful routines and antisocial lifestyles. Nest allows for Rice students to break out of the monotony of classes and homework and enjoy the often underutilized resources on campus, such as going to the Recreation Center, enjoying the beauty of skyspace, or even just eating at different serveries.
